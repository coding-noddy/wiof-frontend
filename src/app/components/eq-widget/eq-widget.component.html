      <strong>What is emotional intelligence or EQ?</strong>
      <br />
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is
        the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive
        ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others,
        overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps
        you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and
        achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect
        with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed
        decisions about what matters most to you.
